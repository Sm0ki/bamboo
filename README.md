Bamboo 
====================
<image src="https://github.com/mr-pandabear/bamboo-utils/raw/master/logo.png" width=350/>

[Bamboo](http://www.bamboocrypto.io) is a minimalist implementation of a layer 1 cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin. It is designed with utmost simplicity and user friendliness in mind and is written from the ground up in C++ â€” it isn't yet another re-packaging of existing open-source blockchain code (where's the fun in that?!). 

### Circulation
Bamboo is minted by miners who earn rewards. Mining payments occur using the following algorithm, which yields a total final circulation of 100M BMB
- 50 BMB per block until block 1M
- 25 BMB per block for blocks 1M to 2M
- 12.5 BMB per block for blocks 2M to 4M

### Technical Implementation
Bamboo is written from the ground up in C++. We want the Bamboo source code to be simple, elegant, and easy to understand. Rather than adding duct-tape to an existing currency, we built Bamboo from scratch with lots of love. There are a few optimizations that we have made to help further our core objectives:
* Switched encryption scheme from [secp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1) (which is used by ETH & BTC) to [ED25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) -- results in 8x speedup during verification and public keys half the size. 
* Up to 25,000 transactions per block, 90 second block time

### Getting Started
*Windows*: 
Windows is not currently supported as a build environment. You may run the [dcrptd miner](https://github.com/De-Crypted/dcrptd-miner/releases) to mine Bamboo

*Mac OSX* build pre-requirements
```
brew install leveldb
brew install cmake
pip3 install conan
```


*Linux* install pre-requirements
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install make cmake automake libtool python3-pip libleveldb-dev
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3.6 1
sudo pip3 install conan
sudo apt install curl
sudo apt install git
```

### Building
```
git clone https://github.com/mr-pandabear/bamboo.git
cd bamboo
mkdir build
cd build
conan install .. --build=missing
cd ..
cmake .
```
To compile the miner run the following command:
```
make miner
```
You will also need the keygen app to create a wallet for your miner:
```
make keygen
```

To compile the node server:
```
make server
```

### Usage
Start by generating `keys.json`.

```
./bin/keygen
```
 ***Keep a copy of this file in a safe location*** -- it contains pub/private keys to the wallet that the miner will mint coins to. If you lose this file you lose your coins. We recommend keeping an extra copy on a unique thumbdrive (that you don't re-use) the moment you generate it.


To start mining:
```
./bin/miner
```

To host a node:
```
./bin/server
```
NOTE: you will need to make a folder `~/bamboo/data` to store the nodes data

### Docker

Bamboo is pre-built for amd64 and arm64 with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/bamboo-crypto/bamboo/actions) and distributed with the [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/bamboo-crypto/bamboo/pkgs/container/bamboo)

#### Running with Docker

with `docker`

```shell
docker run -d --name bamboo -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd)/bamboo-data:/bamboo/data ghcr.io/bamboo-crypto/bamboo:latest server
docker logs -f bamboo
```

You can follow the progress of server sync from `http://localhost:3000`

Running with `docker-compose` is recommended to easily add more options like cpu usage limits and a health checks:

```yaml
version: '3.4'

services:
  bamboo:
    image: ghcr.io/bamboo-crypto/bamboo:latest
    command: server
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      - ./bamboo-data:/bamboo/data
    restart: unless-stopped
    cpus: 8
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-sf", "http://127.0.0.1:3000"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 10s
```

#### Building with docker

Clone this repository and then

```shell
docker build . -t bamboo
docker run [OPTIONS] bamboo server
```

Running CI build locally
```shell
docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install all
docker buildx create --use

GITHUB_REPOSITORY=NeedsSomeValue GITHUB_SHA=NeedsSomeValue docker buildx bake --progress=plain
```
